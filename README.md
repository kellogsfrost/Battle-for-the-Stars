Starship Battle

This game was devolped with:
1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. HTML


Description:

For our first project I built a Starwars themed battleship. A player vs. AI guessing game. The user must find the location of all five enemy ships before the AI finds all user ships. It's a fun game that is easy to pick up as a user. I started by laying out my grids in HTML and CSS. Once I had a basic player and cpu board laid out I started working on the javascript. The script of this game proved more challenging than I expected which made it a great first project! 



Next Step:

There are many things I plan to add to the game over the next few weeks. Random generating ship location for AI. Player drag and drop ships. Music and gifs for intro win and loss. A challenge mode with a shot counter and a larger board.
