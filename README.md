Description:

For our first project I built a Starwars themed battleship. A player vs. AI guessing game. The user must find the location of all five enemy ships before the AI finds all user ships. It's a fun game that is easy to pick up as a user. I started by laying out my grids in HTML and CSS. Once I had a basic player and cpu board laid out I started working on the javascript. The script of this game proved more challenging than I expected which made it a great first project!
